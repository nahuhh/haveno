## What is Haveno Aloha?

Haveno Aloha (pronounced ha‧ve‧no) is an open source platform to exchange [Monero](https://getmonero.org) for fiat currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP or other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and BCH.

Main features:

- Communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy.

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on Haveno Aloha happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: Haveno Aloha supports arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but arbitrators never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because it's not needed. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Monero network.

- There are also **NO FEES** on Haveno Aloha, just volunteers, we operate purely on donations. You're able to do that on our website [https://www.haveno-aloha.com](https://www.haveno-aloha.com)
